# WagerMe 

WagerMe is an iOS, peer-to-peer, trust-based, betting game where users can make custom bets against one another. 

The users earn WagerPoints (in-app currency) in these bets that they can later use to redeem prizes.

Prizes redeemed at local small businesses e.g. "Free Chips and Salsa"

App Monetization created by advertisments such as having users watch daily videos in order to gain WagerPoints. This is to allow user to continue playing once they run out of in-app currency.
